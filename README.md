# Prediction & Segmentation of Bacteria Images with U-Net & AlexNet Architectures

## Overview
**Using U-Net and AlexNet-based algorithms**, we analyze and classify large datasets of microscopic images of bacteria. We use a pre-trained VGG16 model to optimize the prediction and segmentation quality of our algorithms. We receive datasets of bacterial images, and through machine learning algorithms, we enable an assessment of the dataset's quality. Additionally, we perform segmentation and prediction operations on the images, which allows us to differentiate the images into bacterial families such as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we predict the type of bacteria using the AlexNet architecture
